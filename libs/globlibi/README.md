Iterative Globel Model Fitting Library (globlibi)
=================================================

This library contains general code for fitting global geomagnetic models;
it makes use of the [SLATEC library](../slatec/README.md).

The globlibi library is required by the World Magnetic Anomaly Model code (WMAM).
The [build.sh](build.sh) script builds globlibi for [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/).
