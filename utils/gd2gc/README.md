gd2gc
=====

The gd2gc utility is a small code that converts from geodetic to geocentric coordinates.
This utility is used to help generate the input data for the various WMAM test cases.

The gd2gc source is stored in this GitLab repo (alongside WMAM) for convenience.
The [build.sh](build.sh) script builds gd2gc for [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/).
