The WMAM input data is arranged by spherical harmonic degree, L.

The different data sets were provided by Nick Brown.

The list below links each value of L with the resolution degree, X
and with the name of the original archive folder, see

L=200,  X=1.0,  eCSE_short/eCSE_medium
L=300,  X=0.5,  eCSE_long
L=720,  X=0.25,  
L=1440, X=0.1,  mod_wdmam_4Nick_${NNodes}
